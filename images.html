    <h1>Images</h1>
    <p>Let&rsquo;s have some fun with images!!!</p>

    <h2>JPG</h2>
    <p>
      They are good with color pallettes and for high gradient pics, but they
      don&rsquo;t have transparent pixels.
    </p>
    <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="Mochi inside a bubble :)" />

    <h2>GIF</h2>
    <p>
      They have a limited color palette, best for simple animation. They have
      transparent pixels but its set with a binary option therefore it doesnt
      support semi opaque pixels.
    </p>
    <img src="images/mochi.gif" width="75" alt="dancing mochi.....kawaiiii" />

    <h2>PNG</h2>
    <p>
      PNG are best suited for small images like logos, good with opacity and
      have no pallette limitations.
    </p>
    <img src="images/mochi.png" width="75" alt="smiling mochi....CUTE" />

    <h2>SVG</h2>
    <p>
      SVGs are amazing for just about everything. They use vector-based graphics
