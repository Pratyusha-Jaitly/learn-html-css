      <h1>Fist page ever!!!</h1>
      <p>Lets learn some html</p>
      <h2>First para</h2>
      <p>This is the first paragraph</p>
      <h2>Second para</h2>
      <p>This is the second paragraph</p>
      <a href="lists.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"
        ><h2>Lists</h2></a

      <h2>More semantic tags</h2>

      <p>
        <em> Strongly emphasizing </em>
        elements and draws attention
      </p>
      <p>Well, we are going to <strong>super strongly emphasize</strong></p>
      <p>
        This is the new text, and no line break is here even though its in the
        next line in the code
        <br />
        We can't even code an extra space over here but here is the break line
      </p>
      <hr />
      <p>
        The above creates more seperation??? or has more significance than a p
        tag it seems anyway
      </p>
      <p>
        <em><strong>AND THATS!!! IT!!!!</strong></em>
